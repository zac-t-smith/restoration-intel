"""
Smart Alerts Framework for Restoration-Intel

This module provides stub implementations for predictive scenarios and alert mechanisms
that help identify potential business risks and strategic deviations.

Alerts are categorized into:
1. Red Flags: Immediate, critical business health issues
2. Yellow Warnings: Potential risks requiring attention
3. Strategic Drift Indicators
4. Operational Breach Alerts
5. Payment Advisory Mechanisms

Each function is designed as a placeholder to be expanded with actual business logic.
